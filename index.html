<!-- Right now my thinking is a single page, scrolling website. Different columns take different pieces of my interview out of context. The background is made up of imagery capturing sensory elements from the broader conversation: places, colors, smells, etc. Text would be manipulated accordingly to capture cadence and fluctuations in voice. -->

    <div class="wrapper">
        <h1>Bless your heart!</h1>
        <p>That’s basically</p>
        <h1>FUCK YOU</h1>
        <p>in southern.</p>
        <br>

        <p>I guess it really depends on who you’re raised with? Could live in Texas your whole life but if your parents don’t have an accent yOU DON’T. It’s kinda like how people here assume New York is full of that</p>
        <h1>“I’m WaLKiN’ ‘ErE!”</h1>
        <br>



        <p2>I don’t want to know… what kinda life choices you gotta make… to wind up as a rodeo clown.</p2>

        <p>Desperation.</p>

        <p>
            Southern. But i mean THICK.
        </p>

        <p2>Last time I was down there we stopped at a Dunkin Donuts for food and I lost my appetite as soon as I hopped out of the car because the cow shit smell was just… everywhere.</p2>

        <p>Bull Riding, calf roping, barrel racing, steer wrestling, bareback riding, and saddle bronc.</p>

        <p>EVERYONE’s wearing cowboy hats, cowboy boots, Levi jeans, those extra buckles.</p>

        <p> I don’t even own a pair of cowboy boots myself i am a heathen.</p>
